I created this repository in order to serve as a kind of publicly accessible notepad.

As a notepad, it's not a very polished product. I use it do save notes that aren't private and which I think might perhaps be helpful to other people.

I might even use it to host notes that I want to access myself from non-authenticated devices.

It's a very simple configuration. I create the notes using Obsidian which is configured as repo in Git. I just make sure to hide the config folder.

Instructions here if you like the diea:
